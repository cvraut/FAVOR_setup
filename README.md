# FAVOR_setup

Some steps and utilities I used to setup the FAVOR database on a private system

All credit to the FAVOR database and project goes to [Hufeng Zhou](https://github.com/zhouhufeng) [et al.](https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkac966)

Please also check out [FAVORannotator](https://github.com/zhouhufeng/FAVORannotator) for some help in getting started if starting from scratch.

This repo just helps me understand how to integrate their system with the Speliotes-Lab system.
